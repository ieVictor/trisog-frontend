## üóª Challenge

### Challenge Description

You will need to recreate the three pages mentioned above while staying true to your original design.

## üõ† Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): Popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Next-generation front-end tooling that provides fast and optimized development experience.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): JavaScript superset that adds static types and other features to the code.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Package manager for JavaScript, providing fast and reliable dependency management.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs): Hosting platform that allows you to deploy web applications quickly and efficiently, with integrated CI/CD support.

These are the main technologies used to build this front-end application. JavaScript and React are utilized to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Vite is used as the build tool, offering fast and optimized development workflows. TypeScript adds static typing, enhancing code maintainability and robustness. Tailwind CSS provides utility-first classes to style the application quickly and efficiently. Sass is used for writing maintainable and modular CSS. CSS Modules help in creating reusable and scoped CSS. npm is the dependency manager, ensuring reliable and fast package management. The application is deployed on Vercel, ensuring scalable and high-performance hosting.
